![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

![Move demo](media/MoveDemo.gif)

When holding the control key and moving over items in inventory, this mod will move any items that are under the cursor as the user moves the mouse.
This allows the user to quickly move items without having to click each individual item.

# Configuration

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at `%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\MouseMoveTransfer\config.json`.

|Name|Default|Description|
|--|--|--|
|ModifierKey|LeftControl|The key to hold while the mouse is held down to activate the move.  Can be any key, but it is recommended to use LeftControl, RightControl, LeftAlt, or RightAlt|

## Key List
The list of valid keyboard keys can be found  at the bottom of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html
Beware that numbers 0-9 are Alpha0 - Alpha9.  Most of the other keys are as expected such as X for X.
Use "None" to not bind the key.
