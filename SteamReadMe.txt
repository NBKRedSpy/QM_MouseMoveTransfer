Holding control while moving the mouse over items will cause those items to be moved.
This allows the user to quickly move items without having to click each individual item.

The configuration file will be created on the first game run and can be found at [i]%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\MouseMoveTransfer\config.json[/i].
